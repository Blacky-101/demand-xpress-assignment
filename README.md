Contact Book App 📓
This is a full-stack contact management application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It allows users to create, view, and delete contacts with a simple, clean user interface.

Features ✨
Create Contacts: Add new contacts with their name, email, and phone number.
View Contacts: Display a list of all contacts. The list is paginated to handle a large number of contacts efficiently.
Delete Contacts: Remove contacts from the database.
Pagination: Browse through contacts in manageable pages.
Responsive Design: The UI is built with basic CSS to be functional across different devices.

React: A JavaScript library for building the user interface
Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API calls to the backend.

Backend:
Node.js: The JavaScript runtime environment.
Express.js: A web framework for building the REST API.
Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

Database:
