Contact Book App üìì
This is a full-stack contact management application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It allows users to create, view, and delete contacts with a simple, clean user interface.

View Contacts: Display a list of all contacts. The list is paginated to handle a large number of contacts efficiently.
Delete Contacts: Remove contacts from the database.
Pagination: Browse through contacts in manageable pages.
Responsive Design: The UI is built with basic CSS to be functional across different devices.
